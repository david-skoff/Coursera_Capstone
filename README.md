This project shows how a restaurant owner in Toronto can determine the right neighborhood to start a second restaurant in New York City. The Jupyter notebook with Python coding utilizes the Foursquare API to extract venue information and machine learning (k-means clustering) to cluster similar neighborhoods between the two cities. Folium is used to plot geospatial data.
